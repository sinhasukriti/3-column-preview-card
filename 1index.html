          <p class="card-info">
            One of the most common photography styles, portrait photography, or portraiture, aims to capture the personality and mood of an individual or group. Images may be candid or posed, full body or close-ups. Either way, the subjectâ€™s face and eyes are typically in focus. Lighting and backdrop help to convey tone and emotion.

          <h1 class="title">Photojournalism</h1>
          <p class="card-info">
            Photojournalism is a way of telling the story of a newsworthy (perhaps even historic) event or scene through photographs. Photojournalism should be as objective and truthful as possible and capturing candid moments as they happen is more important than getting picture-perfect shots. Generally, photojournalists attend planned events with the hope of capturing unplanned, unscripted moments.
